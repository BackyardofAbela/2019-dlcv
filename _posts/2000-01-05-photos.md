## Project 

The students developed a hands on challenge proposed by [Dr. Rafael Ruiz de Casta√±eda](https://www.unige.ch/medecine/isg/en/staff/rafael-ruiz-de-castaneda/) and the [Institute of Global Health](https://www.unige.ch/medecine/isg/en/) in Geneve (Switzerland) in order to use Deep Learning to detect snake species to prevent snake bites, which cause of [100.000 human deaths each year](https://www.who.int/health-topics/snakebite). This project was selected as on of the most interesting in the recent [CVPR 2019 Workshop on Computer Vision for Globall Challenges](https://www.cv4gc.org/).


The development of this project was kindly sponsored with computation grants from [Google Cloud Education](https://cloud.google.com/edu/). More details in the full [press release](https://github.com/telecombcn-dl/2019-dlcv/raw/gh-pages/assets/dlcv-2019-press.pdf).
