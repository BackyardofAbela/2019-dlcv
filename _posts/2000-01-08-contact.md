This term we will be using [Piazza](https://piazza.com) for class discussion. The system is highly catered to getting you help fast and efficiently from classmates, the TA, and myself. Rather than emailing questions to the teaching staff, I encourage you to post your questions on Piazza. If you have any problems or feedback for the developers, email team@piazza.com.

Find us at the [class page](https://piazza.com/upc/summer2016/230360/home).
