[Piazza](https://piazza.com) will be used for class discussion and communication, instead of the regular UPC Atenea platform. [Piazza](https://piazza.com) is highly catered to getting you help fast and efficiently from classmates, TAs and instructors. Rather than emailing questions to the teaching staff, I encourage you to post your questions on Piazza. If you have any problems or feedback for the developers, email team@piazza.com.

Find us at the [class page](piazza.com/upc/summer2017/230360/home).
