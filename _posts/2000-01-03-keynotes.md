Dr. Laura Leal-Taixé (b. 1984) conducts research in the area of Computer Vision and Machine Learning. In particular, she focuses on video analysis, solving tasks such as multiple object tracking, motion analysis or semantic segmentation. Allowing machines to automatically analyse video data is essential for applications such as Autonomous Driving. Dr. Laura Leal-Taixé was born in Barcelona where she pursued B.Sc. and M.Sc. in Telecommunications Engineering at the Technical University of Catalonia (UPC). She went to Boston, USA to do her Masters Thesis at Northeastern University with a fellowship from the Vodafone foundation. From 2009 until 2013, she worked towards her PhD degree at the Institute for Information Processing (TNT) of the Leibniz University of Hannover in Germany. During her PhD, she was at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, USA for one year as a visiting scholar with Prof. Silvio Savarese. She ithen spent two years as a postdoctoral researcher at the Institute for Geodesy and Photogrammetry at ETH Zürich, Switzerland, working on tracking and benchmarking. In May 2016, she moved to Munich where she started working at the Computer Vision Group as a senior postdoctoral researcher. She is currently a junior group leader after receiving a Sofja Kovalevskaja Award of 1.65 million euros for her project socialMaps.

Dr Kevin McGuinness is an Assistant Professor and Science Foundation Ireland Funded Starting Investigator with the School of Electronic Engineering in Dublin City University. He also works very closely with the Insight Centre for Data Analytics. He finished my B.Sc (Hons) in Computer Applications and Software Engineering in Dublin City University in 2005 and was awarded a Ph.D. from the School of Electronic Engineering in 2009. He has since been a postdoctoral researcher at the CLARITY Centre for Sensor Web Technologies, and a research fellow at the Insight Centre for Data Analytics. His primary research interests are computer vision, deep learning, image and video segmentation, segmentation evaluation, machine learning, content-based multimedia information retrieval, and human-computer interaction.
