You should not sign up for this course. Build a strong basis whether by attending to our next BSc Winter School on [Introduction to Deep Learning](https://telecombcn-dl.github.io/2018-idl/), or signing up for the full master course of [Deep Learning for Artificial Intelligence](https://telecombcn-dl.github.io/2017-dlai/) to be taught during Autumn 2018.
